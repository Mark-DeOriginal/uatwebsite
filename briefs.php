                        <p>Hormonal Imbalance is when one or more hormones become too little or too much in the body. It is mainly caused by endocrine disruptors in junk/processed foods, plastic containers, cosmetics, detergents, insecticides, pesticides, low quality toys and household items. Hyperinsulinemia, gut dysbiosis and certain nutritional deficiencies are major causes too.</p>

                        <h2>UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)</h2>
                        <p>UTI is when there is an infection in one or more parts of the urinary system like the bladder, urethra or kidney. It’s usually caused by microbes that migrated from the gut to the urinary tract, like when e-coli overrun beneficial microbes in the gut, due to antibiotics or excessive acidic internal environment.</p>

                        <p>Erectile Dysfunction is when a Man can’t get or keep a good enough erection for optimal sexual intercourse. We believe that all forms of Male sexual or fertility problem (erectile dysfunction, quick ejaculation, low libido, low sperm count, watery sperm, etc.) are associated with hormonal imbalance (low level of testosterone and/or high level of estrogen), and low level of Nitric-oxide, due to toxins like endocrine disruptors, nutritional deficiencies, too much stress, etc.</p>

                        <p>Pimples and Acnes are skin conditions characterized by red tender bumps with white pus. They are said to be caused by inflamed oil glands or increased presence of pimple causing bacteria. Persisting pimples are caused by one or a combination of hormonal imbalance (excess androgen, sometime with estrogen), nutritional deficiencies (low levels of vitamin A [retinol] and E), liver issues, low level of SHBG, insulin resistance and/or a particular bacteria (propionbacterium) induced infection.</p>

                        <p>HBP is a condition where the force or pressure of blood on the arteries is higher than normal, leading to damage or complications. Nutritional deficiencies like low potassium, magnesium, vitamin K2 and vitamin D3 are usually always implicated as a root cause, as well as insulin resistance and high cortisol.</p>

                        <p>It's normal for candida, yeast and other fungus to be present inside and on the body. It is only a problem when there is an overgrowth, which happens when beneficial bacteria population in the stomach (that is supposed to regulate the fungus population) is destroyed by antibiotics. It is then worsened by the use of birth control pills, antacid and high cortisol due to too much stress.</p>

                        <p>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is the inflammation of the upper part of the genital tract and sometimes the pelvic peritoneum. PID is mainly caused by bacteria such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, both of which are STDs. But E-Coli and other bacteria that causes UTI or those that migrated from the gut due to gut dysbiosis are also major causes.</p>
